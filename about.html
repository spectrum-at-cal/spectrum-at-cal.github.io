                    <li class="slideanim">​​Although it is treatable, there has yet to be found a cause or cure for autism.</li>
                    <li class="slideanim">The rate of autism has steadily grown over the last twenty years, and now affects <i>1 in 59 children.</i></li>

I want to contribute to the club's ever-growing presence on campus so that one day the club may be a well known, safe, and accepting community for all those on the autism spectrum.</p>

                			<p><strong>Why I Joined:</strong> My mother is a special education teacher, and I have volunteered in her classroom since I was around ten years old. When I got to Cal, I was looking for an opportunity to continue working with children with disabilities/accommodations.</p>
                			<p><strong>Goals for Spectrum:</strong> To have as many people consistently taking advantage of our volunteering opportunities, like ESoccer, as possible, because volunteering has impacted my life so significantly, and to establish a mentorship program for high schoolers on the spectrum because they generally receive less support than they need. </p>

                			<p><strong>Goals for Spectrum:</strong> As the education committee chair and instructor for the faculty-sponsored class on autism, my aim to bring about continued education about the different issues and facets of autism to the students at UC Berkeley and in the community.</p>

                			<p><strong>Goals for Spectrum:</strong> Spectrum aims to create a safe space for folks on the spectrum, as well as form a community with everyone who is passionate about awareness.</p>

                            <p><strong>Goals for Spectrum:</strong> My goals for Spectrum are to create a welcoming and inclusive community for those on the spectrum while also destigmatizing many of the tropes and stereotypes often associated with Autism.</p>

                			<p><strong>Goals for Spectrum:</strong> To make our presence here at Cal even more noticeable, especially to those who might not know a lot about Autism, and to ensure that everything we do has a greater purpose that extends beyond the club.

                            <p><strong>Goals for Spectrum:</strong> I want Spectrum to be a place where neurodiverse individuals can feel comfortable and accepted around both other neurodiverse individuals and neurotypicals, rather than ostracized by their peers.</p>

                			<p><strong>Why I Joined:</strong> I got involved in spreading autism acceptance to understand my brother’s experience on the spectrum. In LA I got to be a camp counselor at a camp for teens with special needs, and create a space at my school where those with special needs could socialize. I joined Spectrum to continue being an active advocate while at Cal.</p>
                			<p><strong>Goals for Spectrum:</strong> I’d love to see Spectrum grow in general members! The club does a great job of creating a welcoming environment and regularly has events which I’d encourage everyone to come to!</p>
